      <title>[KLI] Joining Two Sentences With &#34;And&#34;</title>
      <link>https://GodLovesJonny.github.io/post/kli8/</link>

      <description>As mentioned in the previous post, nouns are joined with je.
To join two sentences with &amp;ldquo;and&amp;rdquo; a different word is used: &amp;lsquo;ej.
This word is placed between the sentences.
For example, &amp;ldquo;I run&amp;rdquo; (jIqet) + &amp;ldquo;I jump&amp;rdquo; (jISup) can become &amp;ldquo;I run and I jump&amp;rdquo; (jIqet &amp;lsquo;ej jISup).
&amp;lsquo;ej is only for joining sentences or verb phrases together, not nouns &amp;ndash; you cannot say torgh &amp;lsquo;ej mara, for example.</description>

      <title>[KLI] Klingon Plurals</title>

      <description>English plurals are a good example of using suffixes. In English an -s or an -es is generally added to the end of the noun to make it plural.
Klingon plurals are formed in a similar fashion to the English method of forming plurals. In Klingon a -pu&amp;rsquo;, -Du&amp;rsquo;, or -mey is added to the end of the noun.
These are the &amp;ldquo;Type 2&amp;rdquo; noun suffixes.
Nearly all Klingon nouns belong to one of three groups, depending on which &amp;ldquo;Type 2&amp;rdquo; noun suffix they use to form their plural:</description>

      <title>[KLI] Klingon Verb And Noun Suffixes</title>
      <link>https://GodLovesJonny.github.io/post/kli6/</link>

      <description>Meaning is added to Klingon words through use of syllables added to the front or ends of words.
Syllables added to the beginnings of words are called prefixes and in Klingon indicate who is doing a particular verb and who that action is done to.
Suffixes are added to the ends of words and occassionally you will encounter a word with more than one suffix. Klingon linguists categorize these suffixes according to which ones cannot occur together and what order they must occur in.</description>

      <title>[KLI] Klingon Word Order</title>
      <link>https://GodLovesJonny.github.io/post/kli5/</link>

      <description>Klingon word order in a sentence may seem like the opposite of English word order - first comes the object (if any), then the verb, then the subject. So a sentence such as mara legh torgh means &amp;ldquo;Torg sees Mara&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <title>[KLI] Joining Nouns With And Without &#34;And&#34;</title>
      <link>https://GodLovesJonny.github.io/post/kli4/</link>

      <description>Nouns are joined with je, which comes after the nouns.
If there is no je after two nouns next to each other, the effect is similar to possession: mara pong &amp;ldquo;Mara&#39;s name&amp;rdquo;; tlhIngan Hol &amp;ldquo;a Klingon&#39;s language, the Klingon language&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <title>[KLI] Klingon Verbs</title>
      <link>https://GodLovesJonny.github.io/post/kli3/</link>

      <description>Klingon verbs do not have tense (past, present, future), so a verb such as yaj could mean &amp;ldquo;understands, understood, will understand&amp;rdquo;.
In grammar, a subject is the one doing the action and an object is the one the action is done to. Klingon verbs show the subject and the object of verbs by means of prefixes.
The most important verb prefixes are:
 jI- = I (subject), no object bI- = you (subject), no object &amp;ndash; for single person ma- = we (subject), no object Su- = you (subject), no object &amp;ndash; for multiple people, also some times said as &amp;ldquo;you guys&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;all of you&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;you all&amp;rdquo;, or &amp;ldquo;y&#39;all&amp;rdquo; vI- = I (subject), him/her/it/them (object) Da- = you (subject), him/her/it/them (object) &amp;ndash; for single person  If the subject is third person (he/she/it/they) and has either no object or a third-person object (him/her/it/them), then the verb has no prefix.</description>

      <description>nuqneH is a truncated form of nuq DaneH, meaning &amp;ldquo;What do you want?&amp;rdquo;
It is a common misconception that this is &amp;ldquo;the Klingon word for hello&amp;rdquo;. In fact, Klingons have no word for hello. If a Klingon wishes to say something, they&#39;ll walk up to you and say it, without wasting time - as they see it - on idle chatter.
nuqjatlh? is a truncated form of nuq Dajatlh?, meaning &amp;ldquo;What did you say?</description>
